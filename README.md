# Bamazon

## About
Bamazon is a "Amazon-like" storefront that allows a customer to order items that are stored in an SQL database. SQL queries are built into JavaScript functions to select items and update inventory in the bamazon_db database. Additional JavaScript functionality determines item availability and totals a customer's order. An Inquirer npm package menu guides the customer through the order process.
